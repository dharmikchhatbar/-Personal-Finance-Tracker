# Personal Finance Tracker - Microservices Architecture
The **Personal Finance Tracker** project is a full-stack microservices application that allows users to track their financial transactions, generate reports, and predict future spending trends using AI/ML models. It is built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, **MySQL**, **Docker**, and **Feign Client**, with JWT-based authentication for security.
---

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is structured into two main microservices:

1. **Transaction Service (Port: 8080)**  
   Manages user transactions (income, expenses) and provides REST APIs to interact with the transaction data.

2. **Reporting Service (Port: 8081)**  
   Generates PDF and Excel reports of financial transactions and integrates with an ML service to predict future spending.
